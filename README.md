[![Building Web APIs with Flask](http://img.youtube.com/vi/kO8zr-HO8GA/0.jpg)](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-web-apis/9781491912393/)

The class is structured around two example APIs:

- **orders**: a service that exposes an orders database to clients.
- **camera**: a service that allows clients to take and view pictures. This project is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a camera module, but can also be used on a regular computer with emulated camera hardware.

Instructions on how to install and use these examples is given in the appropraite segments of the class. Please visit the [product page](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-web-apis/9781491912393/) to see the contents of this video.
